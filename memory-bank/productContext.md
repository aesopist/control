# Product Context: Control System

## Purpose and Problem Statement

Control is a device automation agent designed to solve several key challenges in managing multiple Android devices for social media automation:

1. **Scale Management**: Enable efficient management of dozens to hundreds of Android devices from a centralized system
2. **Consistent Execution**: Ensure reliable, repeatable execution of complex workflows across devices
3. **Error Recovery**: Automatically detect and recover from unexpected states and errors
4. **Natural Behavior**: Execute actions with human-like timing and variability to maintain authenticity
5. **Remote Operation**: Allow team members to control devices from anywhere

## User Experience Goals

### For Internal Team Members

- **Simplified Device Management**: Manage multiple devices through a single interface
- **Efficient Workflow Creation**: Record sequences once, then deploy to multiple devices
- **Reliable Execution**: Trust that scheduled tasks will execute properly with minimal supervision
- **Clear Visibility**: See what's happening on all devices in real-time
- **Easy Recovery**: Quickly identify and resolve issues when they occur

### For Clients

- **Direct Access**: View and control their own devices through a secure portal
- **Transparency**: See what actions are being performed on their behalf
- **Performance Metrics**: Track the performance of their social media accounts
- **Content Control**: Easily provide and manage content for posting

## System Interaction Model

Control operates within a larger ecosystem:

1. **Core**: The central intelligence that manages workflows, schedules, and decision-making
2. **Control**: The execution layer that interacts directly with devices (this component)
3. **Cloud**: The communication relay that connects all components
4. **Connect**: The user interface for team members and clients

Control's specific role is to:
- Maintain connections to physical devices
- Execute workflows received from Core
- Capture and verify screens
- Report results back to Core
- Handle recovery when unexpected states occur

## Key Workflows

### Workflow Execution

1. Control receives a workflow package from Core via Cloud
2. Control executes the workflow steps on the specified device
3. Control verifies each step against expected screens
4. Control reports results back to Core
5. If unexpected screens appear, Control initiates recovery

### Live Mode Operation

1. User selects a device in Connect
2. Connect sends commands to Control via Cloud
3. Control executes commands and returns screenshots
4. User can interact with the device in real-time
5. Actions are recorded for potential conversion to sequences

### Recovery Process

1. Control encounters an unknown screen
2. Control sends the screenshot to Core
3. Core determines if it's a known interrupt or truly unknown
4. For known interrupts, Core sends handling instructions
5. For unknown screens, Core sends a FarmCLI recovery script
6. Control executes the recovery and reports results

## Success Criteria

Control is successful when it:

1. Maintains reliable connections to all assigned devices
2. Executes workflows with high success rates (95%+)
3. Quickly identifies and recovers from unexpected states
4. Operates with minimal human intervention
5. Scales efficiently to handle dozens of devices per instance
6. Provides clear reporting on execution status and issues

By fulfilling these criteria, Control enables the efficient management of social media accounts at scale while maintaining the authentic, human-like interaction that distinguishes our service.

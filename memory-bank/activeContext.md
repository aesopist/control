## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Protocol Implementation**:
   - Created protocol.py with message types, binary header format, error handling, and plugin system
   - Added protocol_reference.md to document the protocol design
   - Fixed binary data handling to support string IDs and filenames
   - Implemented ID mapping for testing and debugging

2. **Test Suite Execution**:
   - Successfully ran all binary data handling tests
   - Validated package security with encryption/decryption tests
   - Fixed CloudSimulator to avoid port conflicts and asyncio issues
   - Improved test reliability by removing dependencies on external services

## Recent Changes

- Established basic repository structure
- Created initial component implementations
- Defined clear component boundaries
- Identified key areas for immediate focus
- Clarified execution layer responsibilities

7. **Live Command Implementation**:
   - Created dedicated live/ package for handling live commands
   - Implemented handlers for all command types:
     * Basic device commands (tap, swipe, wake, sleep, keyevent, app_launch)
     * Keyboard sequences with proper delays and humanization
     * Special sequences in sandbox environment
   - Added immediate screenshot capture and return after command execution
   - Standardized command response format with command_id/session_id correlation
   - Streamlined execution by bypassing workflow verification system

Rationale for Live Command Structure:
- Live commands need immediate execution and feedback
- Commands map directly to existing functionality (device commands, keyboard sequences, special sequences)
- Each command is self-contained - no need for sequences or verification
- Screenshot capture is mandatory for visual feedback
- Session/command IDs enable proper response correlation
- Keep command definitions near the handlers in live/ package
- Completed implementation of three critical areas:

1. **Binary Data Handling**:
   - Implemented efficient binary transfer in cloud/binary.py with:
     * Binary frame header structure (package_id, content_id, content_length)
     * Chunking support for large transfers
     * Efficient reassembly of chunked data
   - Enhanced cloud/client.py to handle binary WebSocket frames
   - Added support for screenshots and media files without base64 encoding

2. **Package Security**:
   - Added workflow package decryption using PBKDF2 and Fernet
   - Implemented secure temporary storage with 0o700 permissions
   - Added secure cleanup with data overwriting
   - Protected API keys through environment-based configuration

3. **Execution Simplification**:
   - Refactored workflow execution to remove local decision making
   - Streamlined error handling and status reporting
   - Implemented clean separation between execution and intelligence
   - Simplified sequence execution interface

4. **Protocol Implementation**:
   - Defined and documented protocol specification in protocol_reference.md
   - Implemented protocol.py with:
     * Message type definitions and validation
     * Binary transfer header format with filename support
     * Comprehensive error handling system
     * Extensible plugin architecture for message handlers
   - Created error response format for consistent error reporting
   - Added support for future protocol extensions

5. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created comprehensive test suite with:
     * Workflow builder for generating test packages
     * Cloud simulator for testing WebSocket communication
     * Device simulator for testing ADB interactions
   - Implemented test configuration system
   - Added unit tests for binary data handling
   - Set up logging and cleanup routines
   - Created detailed test documentation

## Documentation Updates
- Updated **Protocol Reference** to include detailed sections on message types, binary header format, standardized error handling, and protocol extensibility, as well as an explanation of internal ID mapping for debugging.
- Expanded **System Patterns** to include a dedicated section on file handling. This section explains that our external components require actual file formats (PNG for images, MP4 for videos) rather than base64‐encoded data. Avoiding base64 not only improves efficiency but also prevents errors in API calls.
